# Android-malware-detection

​     This is a repository about android malware classification. I hope my work will give benefits to distinguish the app between the malware and benign, and if the app is a malware one, what kind of malware family will it belongs to. 

​     This code uses CLC MalDroid 2020 dataset from the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity,a comprehensive multidisciplinary training, research and development, and entrepreneurial unit that draws on the expertise of researchers in the social sciences, business, computer science, engineering, law and science. The dataset divides the malware apps into four families, respectively are Adware, Banking, Riskware,SMS. Because of its too large size, I didn't upload it to the repository. If you want to get it,  please visit (https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/maldroid-2020.html) to download it.

​     Because of the file size limitation in the github repository, I don't push my model args to the repository. If you need it,you can send emails to 835355649@qq.com to get it. I will reply it later if I'm free.
